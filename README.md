# _*:tada: Welcome to my GitHub profile ❗🎉*_

Hello guys:wave:, my name is Lucas Schubert Gomes, a person that loves to learn new things :books:, a Video-Game player 🎮 and movie and series viewer 📸. I'm 20 years old and I'm from Caçapava, São Paulo-Brazil(BR). 

I'm currently studying ***Analysis and Systems Development*** at UNIP São José dos Campos :man_student::mortar_board: and taking courses at Dio's platform to improve even more my knowledge about coding 💻.

I'm at the beginning of my Journey as a coder 🚀, but I discovered my passion for Technology when I was a little boy, during the time that I was used to be part of a Robotics Team.:wrench:🤖

Is a pleasure to meat you ❗
